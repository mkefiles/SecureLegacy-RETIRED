                    SecureLegacy is <b>not</b> some massive company where you are just another number! SecureLegacy is just another family like yours.

                    Mike and Alyssa are husband and wife with their <em>daughter</em> Daisy (a Japanese Chin) and they live in the fine state of Maine.

                    The phrase, "protecting what matters most" is not just another cheesy slogan. Nope. In fact, it is what we aim to do for your family as we have both seen what it is like to have a loved one pass away and, more specifically, we have experienced what happens to the family when the loved one is gone. Finances should <b>never</b> be a concern during a time of grieving and <em>that</em> is where we come in to help!
